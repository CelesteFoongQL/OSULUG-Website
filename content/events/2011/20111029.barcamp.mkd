OSU is once again hosting Beaver BarCamp. Barcamp is a user-generated
conference, where the attendees give all the talks. When you show up you will
find a complex graphing system (butcher paper and sticky notes) that will tell
you what rooms are available when. If you have something you want to give a
talk on, write down the subject and put it on the wall. If not, everyone is
welcome to come and go throughout the day to attend talks. Not only is the
event *FREE*, but there will be swag and food.

When: October 29, 10 AM to 6 PM

Where: Kelley Engineering Center (yes, all of it)
