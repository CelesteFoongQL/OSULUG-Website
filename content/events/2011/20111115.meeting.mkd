---

[David Petersen](http://thedjpetersen.github.com), a former OSU student that
interned at Cloudkick over the summer as a web developer, will be coming down
to give a tutorial on screenscraping. For those who don't know, screenscraping
is the art of pulling information from the web via HTTP requests and generally
parsing the HTML with regex. The talk will most likely be in Python.

In the past, he has screenscraped the [OSU class registration
website](http://github.com/ngokevin/reglib), a CSACS Java applet for
[NET](http://oregonstate.edu/net), and worked on
[soundcloud-dl](/blog/scrape-the-internet-our-python-soundcloud-api/index.html),
a Python Soundcloud API. Screenscraping is an art, and it is quite easy to get
a hang of in Python once you've done it a few times so come and learn!

When: November 15th, 6 PM to 8 PM

Where: Dearborn 212
