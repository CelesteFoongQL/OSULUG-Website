---
A lightning talk is an informal, 5-minute presentation on a topic of your
choice. In honor of valentine's day this week, our theme will be "things we
love about open source". You should give a lightning talk because it's great
practice for presenting at conferences, interviews, or startup pitches. And we
want to know about your favorite open-source project!

When: February 5th, 6 PM

Where: Dearborn 212
