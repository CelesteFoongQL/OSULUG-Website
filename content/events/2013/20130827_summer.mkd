It isn't really a meeting, because we don't vote or conduct Serious Business, 
but people show up and hang out. The school of MIME took away all the 
EECS library furniture, so we're congregating in Kelley Engineering Center
between the 4 large classrooms and using whichever happens to be open. 

When: 6pm

Where: Kelley Engineering Center
