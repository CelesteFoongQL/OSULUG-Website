The #osu-lug channel on Freenode has recently seen a lot of requests for
advice on choosing laptops. Here's a summary of the advice you're likely to
get from each channel member.

### Preferences

I play a bit of Minecraft and occasionally like to compile code or run VMs
locally, so a machine's performace is moderately important. Most of my
schoolwork and real work is done on remote machines while I'm at home or on
campus, so I need at least a couple hours of battery life and good wireless
performance. I usually run Linux Mint or Arch on laptops, and am not a fan of
troubleshooting proprietary driver problems. 

Display quality is not important to me and I don't mind small screens.
Input devices are extremely important to me. I strongly prefer the old style
Thinkpad keyboards and find chicklets unpleasant to type on. The [xkcd
mouse](http://xkcd.com/243/) is my preferred pointing device, so physical
buttons at the top of the touchpad are important to me. I find "clicky"
touchpads difficult to use and dislike integrated buttons. 

### Thinkpad x100e/x120e

They're tiny, light, cheap, and have a flimsy feel compared to "real"
Thinkpads. I got an X100e in my freshman year (2010) and it was fine for
schoolwork, though it tended to heat up badly when playing Minecraft and the
chicklet keyboard was less than ideal. Linux Mint worked out of the box. 

I was carrying the X100e in a non-padded bag with a bunch of other stuff,
dropped it wrong on a tile floor, and the outside of the screen suffered a
sharp impact which caused the display to crack. I replaced it with an X120e,
which was lighter and didn't overheat quite as badly. The batteries of the two
models are interchangeable, as is standard for models within the same Thinkpad
line, which is extremely convenient. 

### Thinkpad T420?

Intel issued it to me during my internship in the summer of 2012. Nice
machine, bombproof-feeling construction, but I found it huge and unwieldy and
it weighed a TON. The keyboard spoiled me for life, and desire for the same
type of keyboard factored into my decision to retire my X120e. 

### Thinkpad X230

Got it new in September 2012, when the model had just been released, due to a
Lenovo store discount for Intel employees at the end of my internship. 

Pros: 
    * light
    * nice screen
    * good specs for the time, 4GB RAM, Intel Core i5 processor, etc.
    * came with option to not include webcam, since I was buying it new
    * xkcd mouse has physical buttons at top of touchpad
Cons: 
    * Chicklet keyboard
    * Clicky touchpad
    * Linux didn't Just Work immediately -- I "fixed" this with the classic
      technique of waiting a couple months then trying again

After having used a nice Thinkpad keyboard all summer, the chicklet keyboard
that shipped with the X230 annoyed me so badly that I ordered an X220 keyboard
(the old style of keys, and more or less the same form factor), dremeled down
the bits that didn't fit, and stuffed it into the X230 chassis. All the
regular keys work fine; the delete/home/end keys in the upper right don't
perform the same functions as they're labeled with but I've just memorized
their new positions and it's not annoying enough to warrant figuring out how
to change their mappings in software. From 2013 onward, Linux Mint and Arch
have Just Worked on this machine. 

It shipped with a 3-cell battery, which slowly wore out until it only held
about 2 hours' charge when it was 3 years old. Upgraded to an SSD and 9-cell
battery in 2014 and can now get ~8 hours of battery life.  

### Other Advice

Assess your priorities for weight and battery life, then buy whatever battery
best fits your use case. The weight and performance differences between
battery sizes are huge. Plan on replacing your battery every 18 months or so
for optimal performance. 

If typing on your machine doesn't feel pleasant any more, try replacing the
keyboard. A new one is typically $15 to $30 and the difference between an old,
grungy laptop keyboard and a brand new one cannot be overstated. It makes it
feel like a new computer, in a way that cleaning the old keyboard just can't.
