[DJ Petersen](http://thedjpetersen.github.com) make a return visit to LUG to
talk about his persistent IRC web client,
[Subway](http://github.com/thedjpetersen/subway). DJ is a former OSU student who
interned at Cloudkick last summer and is currently working as web developer in
Eugene.

Subway was inspired when DJ saw [MostAwesomeDude](http://corbinsimpson.com)
attempting to explain [IRC](http://lug.oregonstate.edu/blog/irc/index.html) and
screen to a non-technical person over at the OSL. Though the idea that many of us
run irssi/weechat on a server on a forked process so that we can come back and
view messages and conversations while we were gone didn't quite sift through. IRC
is like email or a social network to most of us, and it would be nice to bring
people into that network who aren't as technical.

A currently existing persistent IRC web client is grove.io which requires payment,
although it is open source. DJ wanted to extend the capbility of current balancers
such as screen, but that wasn't appropriate for multiple clients.
[Paul Irish](http://paulirish.com), a well-known front-end developer on the
Google Chrome Developer Relations and JQuery teams, had publicly said he wanted
to improve design over the current popular web IRC client,
[webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net) so people spun up qwebirc. Paul Irish
even came into one of our IRC channels to give a shoutout to DJ and Subway.

Though DJ wanted a persistent IRC web client. He collaborated with [Aaron
Kavlie](http://github.com/akavlie), a developer who had written IRC client
libraries in Node, to help develop Subway. As of writing, it is nearly
finished.  Subway has many useful features after persistence such embedded and
collapsible images and Youtube videos, notification sounds, user accounts, and
not forgetting about the slick UI.

Subway contains:

    - NodeJS, a server-side Javascript library.
    - MongoDB, a NoSQL database system
    - node-irc, an IRC library that handles connections, passes messages, and
      handles events
    - socket.io, a NodeJS framework for WebSockets which makes it easier to
      transport data between the backend and client
    - backbone.js, a Javascript MVC framework that structures Javascript
      applications used for UI management.

Check out Subway as well as its code because it is a very slick project built
on very modern (and for some, hated) web technologies.
