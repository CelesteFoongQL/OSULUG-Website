Oh, the love is in the air. For Valentine's Day, LUG got together and shared
pieces of software or technology that they loved.

###rTorrent - Jacques Uber###
Tell subsonic to look at directory where music is downloaded. rTorrent watches
a directory for new torrents. When it sees one it downloads it. Subsonic then
sees the new media file, indexes it, and serves it. You can simply scp a
torrent file over and it will automatically torrent and serve it. Ready to
listen!

###Flask - Corbin Simpson###
Flask is a Python web framework that lets you create website
insanely fast yet scales well.

        import flask
        app = flask.Flask(__name__)

        counter = 0

        @app.route("/")
        def index():
            global counter
            counter + = 1
            return """<p>I &hearts; flask!</p>"
                <p>I have been viewed %d times</p>""" % (counter)


        @app.route("/blink/<int:d>") # parameter d
        def blink(d):
            return """<blink>Do I blink?</blink><p>
                You entered %d.</p>""" % d

Don't need any additional folders/files/settings besides above.
It just works; no need to have your views here and your urls
there.

###Puppet - Daniel Thornton###
Puppet is a program that lets you configure computers from a set
of configuration files. It has modules that configures various
applications.

Can install vim and move vim configs to appropriate directory.
Install all files and sets up all programs.

###Radio Repeaters - Anthony Odenthal###
Wake up seldom-used 77-repeater on roof of Dearborn. Gave a call
sign, radio did some cool beeping. Responded with call sign in Morse
"W7-OSU-R" -R indicates it is a repeater. Responded with
voice emulator. If cell phones go down, the repeater still works.

Like an old school IRC.

Valentine's Day has a history of romance on the radio network.

###units - Mike Cooper###

###Synapse - Kevin Ngo ###
