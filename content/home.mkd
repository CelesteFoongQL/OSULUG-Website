##Welcome to the OSU LUG website!
<br/>

**New officers have been elected!** See the [contact page][people] for their
names, IRC handles, and bios!

To contribute ideas about what you'd like to see at LUG meetings this year, add them to [the etherpad][meetings].


We keep in touch via the [mailing list][ml], and via the `#osu-lug` IRC
channel on `irc.freenode.net`. For more info on IRC, check out our [IRC
guide][ircguide].

**If you're currently an OSU student and would like to become an official
voting member of LUG**, please fill out this [member form][form].

LUG meets every week on
**Tuesday at 6:00pm at Kelly Engineering Center in KEC 1003**.
Keep an eye out for helpful information and upcoming events posted here. We
also have lunch together on Fridays, at a time determined in the IRC channel.
